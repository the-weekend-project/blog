# The Weekend Project

**The Weekend Project** is a blog for documenting and discussing the latest tech we've experimented with over the weekend.

It is a sum of "weekend projects" in itself, as it begins with an experiment in souping up a modest blog site using a back-end in [Go][].

## Project Timeline

**Phase 1**:

1. Experiment with Go
2. Simple API endpoints for the posts and the users/authors
3. Simple front-end (Probably React + Redux, but maybe Angular 2)
4. ???
5. Profit!
